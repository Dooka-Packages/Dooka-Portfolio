```info
Unicode Plus is a template subpack that's designed to help you organize and add your own Unicode characters to MCBE. 
Unicode is a character encoding standard that's used to display images or hex images, such as "î„€". These characters 
can be used in chat or seen in the MCBE "how to play" screen. I have created a very simple Unicode pack that may 
be helpful, but could also be a hassle to use. I have decided to update and organize the Unicode characters so that 
they are usable in chat or in packs.

> I have added multi glyph textures you can edit in the "edit" folder. These are simply the same images as the
default glyph but without the lines, numbers, or just transparent. If you use these make sure to replace them
with the default glyph not in the "edit" folder. 

### Why is my pack not updating when i add new Unicode?
```info
Make sure to change the pack manifest UUID's only once when your transfering the pack into your
"development_resource_pack" folder in the "com.mojang" folder. If there are still issues 
with the pack not updating contact me on Discord @Dooka#6412.
