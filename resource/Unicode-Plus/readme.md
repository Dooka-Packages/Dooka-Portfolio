Unicode Plus is a template subpack that's designed to help you organize and add your own Unicode characters to MCBE. 
Unicode is a character encoding standard that's used to display images or hex images, such as "î„€". These characters 
can be used in chat or seen in the MCBE "how to play" screen. I have created a very simple Unicode pack that may 
be helpful, but could also be a hassle to use. I have decided to update and organize the Unicode characters so that 
they are usable in chat or in packs.
```
```diff
- Access the Pack contents in the com.mojang folder. Make sure the pack is moved to the "development_resource_pack" -
flder if any edits are done to the glyph textures. If you need help contact me @Discord - Dooka#6412 :). -

```info
As a Unicode subpack, you have the option to switch between glyph templates. In this setting, you can choose 
from glyph-E1, or 2A Unicode templates. Below, you will find a custom Unicode list for the specific glyph you have 
selected, which you can use to test your edits and unicode out.
