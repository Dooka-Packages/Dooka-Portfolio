```info
Unicode Plus is a template subpack that's designed to help you organize and add your own Unicode characters to MCBE. 
Unicode is a character encoding standard that's used to display images or hex images, such as "î„€". These characters 
can be used in chat or seen in the MCBE "how to play" screen. I have created a very simple Unicode pack that may 
be helpful, but could also be a hassle to use. I have decided to update and organize the Unicode characters so that 
they are usable in chat or in packs.

```info
Make sure to change the pack manifest UUID's only once when your transfering the pack into your
"development_resource_pack" folder in the "com.mojang" folder. If there are still issues
